\chapter{Plagiarism in Modeling Assignments}\label{cha:mde1}


As modeling assignments become more common in computer science education~\cite{Ciccozzi2018, Brambilla2017}, plagiarism detection for these assignments becomes more relevant. However, there is little research on plagiarism detection for artifacts of modeling assignments \cite{Martinez2020}.
This chapter discusses the challenges of modeling plagiarism, presents a controlled experiment on how novice modelers obfuscate plagiarism, and empirically explores how generative AI can be exploited for modeling plagiarism.
This chapter discusses the nuances of plagiarism within modeling assignments, including obfuscation techniques and effective detection methods.

The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows:
First, in \autoref{sec:mde-considerations}, we examine the differences between modeling artifacts and code. We outline four key challenges that arise when detecting plagiarism in modeling contexts.
One of these challenges, the lack of knowledge on modeling plagiarism, is explored in \autoref{sec:human-plagiarism} through an experiment investigating how novice modelers engage in plagiarism.
Finally, \autoref{sec:ai-plagiarism} explores the automated aspect of obfuscation, examining how generative AI can be exploited to facilitate plagiarism in modeling assignments.
