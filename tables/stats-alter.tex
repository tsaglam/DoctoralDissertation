\caption[Statistical Tests: Alteration-based Obfuscation]{One-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test results for \textbf{alteration-based obfuscation} regarding the improvement by our defense mechanism compared to baseline (sig. level of $\alpha=0.01$, alternative hypothesis $H1=greater$, test statistic $W$, effect size via Cliff's delta $\delta$, its interpretation $\delta\,Int.$, its 95 percent confidence interval $CI$, and the sample size $n$). For plagiarism-to-source pairs (P2S), low $p$ and high $\delta$ are desirable.}
